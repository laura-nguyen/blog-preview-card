## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively use the clamp() function in CSS to create responsive designs. The clamp() function provides a way to define responsive values with a minimum, preferred, and maximum value, ensuring smoother transitions between different screen sizes.

Additionally, I improved my understanding of creating and styling box shadows. The drop shadow effect has become a popular design trend, and this project provided an excellent opportunity to practice implementing it using CSS.

### Continued development

I aim to continue exploring various styling and responsive design techniques. I am particularly excited about learning new methods that enhance user experience and make web interfaces more intuitive and engaging.
